# Low Orbit Push Cannon
With the early death of Parse.com, alternatives must be made.
This project intends to be an open-source, self-hosted alternative.

## TLS

This project requires TLS by default. **If you'd like to use it with regular HTTP, just don't**. You'll have to modify the source code. Please, don't. Just get a certificate for free from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) and use TLS.

## SDKs

- [iOS 8.0 & up (Swift 2.x)](https://github.com/rafaelc0sta/lopc_swift)

## Status

We've got iOS pushes working great, a relatively decent Web UI that uses only the API (as opposed to going to the DB).

## How-to setup

~~Run the CLI, seed the server and then run the app.js :)~~
(need to update this)

## TODO:

- A decent documentation
- a lot more stuff
- Add decent authentication
- Add Custom Payload updating
- Android Version

## How can I contribute

Right now, you *can't*. When I get a barebones version of this thing working, I'll start
accepting PRs
