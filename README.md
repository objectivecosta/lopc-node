# Low Orbit Push Cannon
With the early death of Parse.com, alternatives must be made.
This project intends to be an open-source, self-hosted alternative.

## SDKs

There are none, as of yet.

## How-to setup

~~Run the CLI, seed the server and then run the app.js :)~~
(need to update this)

## TODO:

- A decent documentation
- A decent API
- a lot more stuff
- Add decent authentication
- Add Custom Payload updating

## How can I contribute

Right now, you *can't*. When I get a barebones version of this thing working, I'll start
accepting PRs
