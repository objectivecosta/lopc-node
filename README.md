# Low Orbit Push Cannon
With the early death of Parse.com, alternatives must be made.
This project intends to be an open-source, self-hosted alternative

## SDKs 

There are none, as of yet.

## How-to setup

Run the CLI, seed the server and then run the app.js :)

## TODO:

- A decent documentation
- A decent API
- a lot more stuff

## How can I contribute

Right now, you can't. When I get a barebones version of this thing working, I'll start 
accepting PRs
